I had created a Python notebook implementing a recommendation system using collaborative filtering with matrix factorization (SVD) using the MovieLens dataset. The system will recommend movies based on user ratings, and I'll include evaluation metrics like RMSE(Root Mean Squared Error) and MAE(Mean Absolute Error).

OUTPUT:

Model Evaluation Metrics:<br/>
RMSE: 0.8942<br/>
MAE: 0.6923<br/>

Top 5 Movie Recommendations for User 1:<br/>
   movieId                                         title<br/>
0        1                              Toy Story (1995)<br/>
1        2                                Jumanji (1995)<br/>
318    356                          Forrest Gump (1994)<br/>
356    480                         Jurassic Park (1993)<br/>
780   1196  Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back (1980)<br/>
